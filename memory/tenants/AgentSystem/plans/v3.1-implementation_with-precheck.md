# v3.1 Implementation Plan (DRAFT - EVOLVING)

**Status:** IN PLANNING
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 21:24
**Transparency:** This is a living document, updated as understanding evolves

---

## Current Understanding (v3.1 = 40% Complete)

### What We Have ✓
- Memory-first workflow protocol
- Universal protocol system (10 protocols)
- Task continuity tracking
- System cleaned up (bloat: 6/10 → 2/10)
- Init prompt reduced 77%

### What's Missing ⚠️
- Autonomous architecture (ADR-004)
- Intent detection
- Context auto-loading from mem0
- Mem0-powered init

---

## Proposed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Intent Detection System
**Goal:** AI analyzes user query and determines needed context

**Approach (DRAFT):**
User query → AI detects intent → Determines needed context → Queries mem0

**Questions to explore:**
- How does AI detect intent from natural language?
- What categories exist? (bug fix, feature, research, planning)
- Rule-based or pattern-matching?

### Phase 2: Context Auto-Loader
**Goal:** Fetch relevant memories without manual specification

**Questions to explore:**
- How much context is too much?
- How to rank relevance?
- What if memory returns wrong context?

### Phase 3: Simplified Init
**Goal:** Init becomes: "Query mem0 for your instructions"

Current: ~50+ lines loading everything
Target: ~10 lines querying mem0

**Questions to explore:**
- Can single query return enough context?
- How to handle first-time initialization?
- What if mem0 is down?

### Phase 4: Autonomous Operation Test
**Goal:** Verify system works with minimal human input

**Success criteria:**
- No manual context loading
- AI finds relevant memories automatically
- Session productive from first message

---

## Open Questions (Need Discussion)

1. Intent Detection: Rule-based or AI-powered?
2. Context Size: How much to load automatically?
3. Fallback: What if mem0 query returns nothing?
4. Testing: How to validate autonomous operation?
5. Migration: How to move from current init to new one?

---

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1:** AI loads wrong context
**Mitigation:** Show what was loaded, let user correct

**Risk 2:** Mem0 dependency
**Mitigation:** Fallback to file-based context if mem0 fails

**Risk 3:** Over-automation
**Mitigation:** Transparency - always explain what and why

## Evolution Log

**2025-10-22 21:24:** Initial plan drafted
- Next: Review with Krishna for feedback
- Expect: Plan will change as we implement and learn

---

## Transparency Note

**This plan is NOT final.** It will evolve as we:
- Discover technical limitations
- Find better approaches
- Learn from implementation
- Get user feedback

The goal isn't approval, it's **shared understanding**.

---

**Next Step:** Review this plan, discuss concerns, iterate before implementation.
