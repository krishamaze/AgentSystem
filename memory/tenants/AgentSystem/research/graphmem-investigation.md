**Status:** RESEARCHED (Not yet implemented)
**Created:** 2025-10-22 17:53

## Summary
GraphMem is Mem0's graph-based memory architecture for storing facts as nodes and relationships. Currently available in open-source version, not confirmed for Platform API.

## Key Findings
- Platform API: Flat atomic facts (current implementation ✓)
- GraphMem: Requires Neo4j, available in open-source version
- Migration not urgent at current scale (88 facts)
- Revisit when: >1,000 facts or complex relationship queries needed
