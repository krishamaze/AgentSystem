# Rotational Protocol Injection System

**Problem:** Long threads cause AI to forget critical rules (batch commands, memory-first, etc.)

**Solution:** Inject one rotating protocol reminder with every PowerShell output

---

## Implementation

### Protocol Pool (Rotate through these)
1. **Batch Rule:** Provide 3-5 commands max per response
2. **Memory-First:** Query mem0 before creating files
3. **Predictive Context:** Show next step + relevant context
4. **Transparency:** Explain what you loaded and why
5. **Task Continuity:** Check for incomplete tasks

### Injection Pattern

**Every PowerShell output ends with:**
\\\
✓ Command executed

📌 Protocol Reminder #3: Predictive Context
   After completing a step, predict next step and query mem0 for:
   - Common errors
   - Success patterns
   - Related learnings
\\\

**AI must acknowledge:**
\\\
Acknowledged: Predictive context protocol active.
Next step: [prediction]
Querying mem0 for relevant context...
\\\

## Enhanced start-session.ps1

Add protocol injector:
\\\powershell
# At end of start-session
\ = @(
    "Batch Rule: 3-5 commands max per response",
    "Memory-First: Query mem0 before creating files",
    "Predictive Context: Show next step + context",
    "Transparency: Explain what you loaded",
    "Task Continuity: Check incomplete tasks"
)

\ = (Get-Date).Minute % \.Count
Write-Host "
📌 Protocol Reminder #\: \" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   (Acknowledge in your response)" -ForegroundColor Gray
\\\

---

## Benefits

1. **Constant reinforcement** without spam
2. **Rotational** - different reminder each time
3. **Acknowledgment required** - AI can't ignore
4. **Context maintenance** - long threads stay aligned
5. **Transparent** - User sees what AI is being reminded

## Alternative: Smart Injection

**Trigger-based instead of rotational:**
- File creation → Inject memory-first reminder
- Multi-step task → Inject predictive context
- Long thread (>20 exchanges) → Inject batch rule

---

**My recommendation:** Hybrid
- Default: Rotational (every 5-10 exchanges)
- Smart: Trigger on specific patterns
- Critical: Always show in start-session

---

**Next Step:** Implement rotational injector in start-session.v3.1.ps1
