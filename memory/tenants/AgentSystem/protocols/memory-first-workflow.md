# Memory-First Development Workflow

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-22 19:57
**Status:** ACTIVE PROTOCOL
**Type:** Core System Pattern

## Overview

Traditional: Plan → Code → Execute → Hope
Memory-First: Query Memory → Analyze → Enhance/Create → Sync Learning

## The Protocol (6 Steps)

### Step 1: Query Memory First
Before any task, search memory for existing solutions.

### Step 2: Analyze Response
- 90%+ match: Update existing
- 50-90% match: Review and decide
- <50% match: Safe to create new
- 0 results: Greenfield

### Step 3: Check Specific Files
Only check files memory mentions. Trust memory's guidance.

### Step 4: Decide Action
- Exists + complete → Skip
- Exists + incomplete → Enhance
- Missing → Create new
- Duplicate → Consolidate

### Step 5: Execute with Explanation
- One step at a time
- Explain in thread
- Show reasoning
- Document as you go

### Step 6: Sync Learning Back
After completion, sync the learning, decision, and outcome to mem0.

## Benefits

- Prevents system bloat
- Builds institutional knowledge
- Faster development
- Self-improving system

## Examples from Today

### Example 1: Master Index Task
Query: "master index system"
Memory: Found system-index.json exists
Decision: Update existing
Result: Saved 30+ minutes

### Example 2: Error Learning
Query: "PowerShell quote escaping"
Memory: No solution found
Decision: Document for future
Result: Won't repeat mistake

## Integration

Every session: Check memory first
Every tool: Search before creating
Every completion: Sync learning back
