# Predictive Context Injection Protocol

**Purpose:** Load relevant context BEFORE each step, not after asking

---

## The Problem

**Current flow:**
1. Execute step
2. User asks: What's next?
3. AI loads context
4. AI suggests next step

**Problem:** Reactive, wastes time

---

## The Solution: Predictive Context

**Enhanced flow:**
1. Execute current step
2. **AI predicts next step** from plan
3. **AI queries mem0 for:**
   - Common errors in this task
   - Success patterns
   - Related learnings
4. **AI shows context + suggests next step**

---

## Implementation Pattern

\\\python
def execute_with_prediction(current_step, plan):
    # 1. Execute current step
    result = execute_step(current_step)
    
    # 2. Update memory FIRST (before fetch)
    client.add([{
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"Completed: {current_step.name}"
    }], user_id="AgentSystem")
    
    # 3. Predict next step from plan
    next_step = plan.get_next_step(current_step)
    
    # 4. Query context for next step
    context = client.search(f"""
        {next_step.keywords}
        common errors
        success patterns
        learnings
    """)
    
    # 5. Show result + context + prediction
    print(f"✓ {current_step.name} complete")
    print(f"\nPredicted next: {next_step.name}")
    print(f"\nRelevant context:")
    for mem in context['results'][:5]:
        print(f"  • {mem['memory']}")
    
    return next_step
\\\

## Example: System Cleanup

**Step 3 completes:**
\\\
✓ Archived manual Backups/ folder

Predicted next: Consolidate knowledge files

Relevant context:
  • 5 learned-knowledge.md files found in system
  • Common error: Forgetting to check archive/ for duplicates
  • Success pattern: Make memory/system/feedback/improvements.md canonical
  • Previous bloat cleanup reduced duplicates by 60%
  
Execute next step? (y/n)
\\\

---

## Example: v3.1 Implementation

**Step 1 completes:**
\\\
✓ Intent detection system created

Predicted next: Build context auto-loader

Relevant context:
  • Common error: Loading too much context (slows response)
  • Success pattern: Rank by relevance, limit to top 10 results
  • Related: BOM context loading had similar requirements
  • Learning: Always show what context was loaded (transparency)
  
Execute next step? (y/n)
\\\

## Benefits

1. **No wasted queries** - Context loaded proactively
2. **Error prevention** - Common mistakes shown upfront
3. **Faster execution** - No waiting for "what's next?"
4. **Continuous learning** - Each step feeds next step
5. **Transparent** - Always shows why context is relevant

---

## Integration with Memory-First

**Enhanced 6-step protocol:**

1. Query memory for existing solution
2. Analyze confidence
3. Check specific files
4. Decide action
5. **Execute + Update memory + Predict next + Query context**
6. Sync learning

**Step 5 becomes:**
- Execute current step
- Update mem0 immediately
- Predict next step from plan
- Query context for next step
- Show everything together

---

## Implementation: Enhanced Tool

**tools/execute-step.ps1:**
\\\powershell
param(
    [string]\,
    [string]\memory\tenants\AgentSystem\tasks\mem0-investigation.md = "memory/tenants/AgentSystem/plans/current.md"
)

# Execute step
# ... actual work ...

# Update memory
python update_memory.py "\ completed"

# Predict next
\ = python predict_next_step.py "\memory\tenants\AgentSystem\tasks\mem0-investigation.md" "\"

# Query context
python query_step_context.py "\"

# Show all together
Write-Host "✓ \ complete" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "
Predicted next: \" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "
Relevant context:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
# ... show context ...
\\\

---

## Key Principle

**Update memory BEFORE fetching context**
- Prevents loops
- Ensures fresh context
- Mem0 processes in ~30s, but we continue immediately
- Next query gets updated context

---

## When to Use

- Any multi-step workflow
- Implementation tasks
- Cleanup operations  
- Any time there's a plan with steps

---

**Next Step:** Implement execute-step.ps1 tool with predictive context
