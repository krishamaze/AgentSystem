## RECOMMENDATION

**Implement Phase 1 (Vector Embeddings) immediately.**

This provides the highest ROI with minimal effort and cost. It leverages existing infrastructure and enables Phase 2 in the future. The semantic search capabilities will significantly improve the system's knowledge retrieval and task recommendation quality.

**Phase 2 (Graph Memory) should follow after Phase 1 stabilizes** to add relationship tracking and advanced analysis capabilities.
