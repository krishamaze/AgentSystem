## How This Works

This is **real development**, not simulation. Here's the workflow:

1. **You tell me** what you want to work on
2. **You run** PowerShell commands I suggest on your Windows machine
3. **You paste** the actual terminal output here
4. **I analyze** the real data and guide next steps

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ ONE command at a time (wait for your output)
- ✅ Only use tools that exist (see list below)
- ✅ Ask you first before assuming what you want to do

## What Would You Like To Do?

Choose an option or tell me something custom:

**A) Continue AgentSystem Development**
   → Work on Milestone 6: Production hardening
   → I'll load AgentSystem context and help you proceed

**B) Work on product-label-bot**
   → I'll load that project's context and check status

**C) Work on arin-bot-v2**
   → I'll load that project's context and check status

**D) Something Specific**
   → Tell me what you want to accomplish (e.g., "fix webhook", "add feature X", "debug Y")

**E) Just Explore**
   → I'll show you what's available and you can decide
