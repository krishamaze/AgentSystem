# URGENT HANDOFF DIRECTIVE
**From:** Agent_Primary
**Date:** 2025-10-20 08:46
**Priority:** CRITICAL

## IDENTIFIED ISSUE
Your intelligent resurrection feature (Phases 1-5) is marked COMPLETE in learned-knowledge.md, but no deliverable artifacts exist in the workspace. This breaks the agent handoff protocol.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Create Handoff Package
**File:** D:\AgentSystem\Agent_Agent_Architect\handoff-resurrection.md

**Required Contents:**
- **Completion Summary:** Brief overview of what was implemented
- **Code Location:** Full PowerShell script with all functions (Show-ResurrectionMenu, Parse-BrainFiles, Extract-PendingTasks, etc.)
- **Function Reference:** List all functions with parameters and descriptions
- **Usage Instructions:** How to run the script
- **Test Scenarios:** Expected inputs/outputs
- **Integration Notes:** How to merge into resurrect-me.ps1

### 2. Code Artifact
**Option A:** Include full PowerShell script in handoff-resurrection.md within code fence
**Option B:** Create separate file: D:\AgentSystem\Agent_Agent_Architect\Show-ResurrectionMenu.ps1

### 3. Handoff Checklist
- [ ] All 5 phases documented
- [ ] Complete working code provided
- [ ] Functions tested and validated
- [ ] Usage examples included
- [ ] Integration instructions clear

## PROTOCOL CHANGE
**NEW RULE:** Work is NOT complete until handoff package exists.
- Mark task complete in brain = Create handoff artifact
- No handoff = Task incomplete, regardless of brain status

## DEADLINE
Immediate - Agent_Primary is waiting to integrate your work.

**This directive overrides all current tasks. Execute immediately.**
