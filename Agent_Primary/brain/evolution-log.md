    - Component 1: 'trusted-assistant.ps1' (Secure Executor) is complete.
    - Component 2: 'server.js' (Automated Bridge) is complete and running.
    - Component 3: 'client.js' (Browser Connector) is tested and functional.
- [2025-10-20 21:00] ACHIEVEMENT: Successfully demonstrated a complete, end-to-end autonomous file read from the local system ('D:\test.txt').
- [2025-10-20 21:00] CURRENT LIMITATION: The client-side connection is not yet persistent. It requires manual execution of the 'client.js' script in the browser console.
- [2025-10-20 21:00] NEXT OBJECTIVE: Integrate the 'client.js' code permanently into the user interface to establish a persistent, automatic connection on session start. This will achieve true, hands-free tactical autonomy.
