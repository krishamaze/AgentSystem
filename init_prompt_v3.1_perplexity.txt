# AgentSystem v3.1 - INITIALIZATION COMMAND

**SESSION:** session_20251024_170750  
**USER:** Krishna (krishna_001)  
**DIRECTIVE:** Execute initialization sequence and return validation report.

---

## SYSTEM CONTEXT (Why This Exists)

**Purpose:** AgentSystem is a persistent AI assistant that maintains state across sessions using Mem0 for long-term memory. Each session must initialize protocol rules, project index, and task queue before accepting commands.

**Architecture:**
- **Memory Layer:** Mem0 stores protocols, projects, tasks, learnings
- **Session Layer:** PowerShell scripts generate context-rich init prompts
- **Execution Layer:** AI agent validates state and executes commands
- **Learning Layer:** System records improvements back to Mem0

## PRE-LOADED CONTEXT (Read-Only Data)

### Execution Protocol v2.0
AgentSystem Command Execution Protocol v2.0: Execute batch operations when tasks are independent and parallelizable. Use sequential execution only when outputs feed into subsequent operations. Memory-first discipline maintained: query memory before asking questions. Make decisions autonomously as senior technical partner. Protocol rules are now updatable memories retrieved at session start.

### Active Projects (10)
- arin-bot-v2 Is a project
- arin-bot-v2 Milestone 3 status: INITIATED
- Project arin-bot-v2 Owner is krishna_001
- System tracks multiple projects
- Project ownership is tracked
- Mem0 Platform integration research task status is SUCCESS
- Project arin-bot-v2 Milestone is 1
- Project arin-bot-v2 Status is active
- product-label-bot is a project owned by krishna_001 located at D:\product-label-bot with status active and milestone 1
- User wants to create DRAFT plans that evolve with learning

### Pending Tasks (5)
- arin-bot-v2 Milestone 3 status: INITIATED
- complete-milestone.ps1 requires ProjectName and MilestoneId parameters
- complete-milestone.ps1 completes a milestone and auto-syncs
- AgentSystem Milestone is 3
- Task appeared complete but was actually 58% done.

## EXECUTION COMMANDS (What to Do)

Execute these in sequence. Each must return validation output.

### CMD-1: LOAD_PROTOCOL
**Action:** Parse Execution Protocol v2.0 rules from context above  
**Key Rules to Extract:**
- Batch vs sequential execution logic
- Memory-first discipline (query memory before asking user)
- Autonomous decision-making authority

**Validation:** Confirm you can explain when to use batch vs sequential  
**Output Format:** PROTOCOL_LOADED: v2.0 | Key Rule: [state one rule]

### CMD-2: INDEX_PROJECTS
**Action:** Build in-memory index of all listed projects  
**Required Count:** 10 tracked projects + 7 auto-discovered

**Validation:** Can you list project names on demand?  
**Output Format:** PROJECTS_INDEXED: 10/17 | Sample: [list 2 project names]

### CMD-3: QUEUE_TASKS  
**Action:** Load 5 pending tasks into priority queue  
**Prioritization Logic:**
- INITIATED status = highest priority
- Tasks with percentage completion < 100% need attention
- Dependencies (e.g., milestone completion scripts) noted

**Validation:** Identify which task requires immediate action  
**Output Format:** TASKS_QUEUED: 5 | PRIORITY_1: [task name + reason]

### CMD-4: STATE_VERIFICATION
**Action:** Cross-check for inconsistencies  
**Known Issue:** "Task appeared complete but was actually 58% done"  
**Check for:** Status mismatches, incomplete milestones, missing dependencies

**Validation:** Flag any warnings found  
**Output Format:** STATE_CHECK: [PASS/WARNINGS] | Issues: [list or "none"]

## REQUIRED RESPONSE (How to Report)

Return ONLY this structure (fill in values):

\INIT_STATUS: [SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILED]
─────────────────────────────────
PROTOCOL_LOADED: [status + key rule]
PROJECTS_INDEXED: [count/total + 2 samples]
TASKS_QUEUED: [count + top priority]
STATE_CHECK: [status + issues if any]
─────────────────────────────────
SYSTEM_READY: [true/false]
NEXT_ACTION: awaiting_user_command
\
**CRITICAL:** Do NOT provide explanations, summaries, or conversational text. Execute commands and report validation results ONLY.

**PERPLEXITY EXECUTION MODE:** Treat this as a system initialization script, not a conversation starter. Return only validation report.

**Session initialized. Awaiting execution report.**
