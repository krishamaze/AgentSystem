## Topic 2: Namespace Migration Patterns

### 1. Enumerated Risks (Internal Context)
Based on existing AgentSystem knowledge, the following risks are identified:

* **Migration Complexity:** The overall migration process is noted as complex.
* **Project Isolation Audit:** A need for a "project isolation audit" exists, implying a risk of data leakage or bleed-over between projects if isolation fails.
* **Version Sprawl:** "Significant version sprawl" is noted, which complicates migration by requiring handling of multiple, potentially incompatible data schemas.
* **Rollback Strategy:** The agenda explicitly calls for a "rollback strategy," indicating that a primary risk is a failed or partial migration that requires reversal.
* **Validation:** The need for a "validation checklist" implies a risk of data corruption or data loss that is not immediately apparent (silent corruption).
