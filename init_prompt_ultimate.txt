# IMPORTANT: This is NOT a hypothetical scenario or roleplay

**I am Krishna, a real developer with a real codebase at D:\AgentSystem on my Windows PC.**

I will PASTE ACTUAL OUTPUTS from my terminal into this chat. You will help me by analyzing those outputs and suggesting next commands.

---

## What Just Happened Before This Session

I built a persistent AI agent system with:
- 55+ learnings stored in structured files
- 3 active projects being tracked
- Multi-tenant architecture with lazy loading
- Tools that query real files on my machine

**You helped me build this in previous Perplexity threads.** This is session continuation.

---

## How This Works (Step by Step)

1. I open PowerShell on my Windows machine
2. I run: `cd D:\AgentSystem`
3. I run commands you suggest (like `.\tools\list-projects.ps1`)
4. I copy the ACTUAL OUTPUT from my terminal
5. I paste it here in this chat
6. You analyze the real data I pasted
7. You give me the NEXT SINGLE COMMAND to run
8. Repeat

**This is real software development.** The files exist. The data is real. You are helping me build and improve this system.

---

## CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **ONE COMMAND AT A TIME** - Give me exactly 1 PowerShell command, wait for output
2. **ONLY USE TOOLS THAT EXIST** - Do not suggest commands that aren't in the list below
3. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - If you need to know what tools exist or what data is available, ask me to run a command first

---

## EXACT TOOLS AVAILABLE (DO NOT INVENT OTHERS)

- `.\tools\check-memory.ps1`
- `.\tools\complete-milestone.ps1`
- `.\tools\create-adr.ps1`
- `.\tools\list-adrs.ps1`
- `.\tools\list-projects.ps1`
- `.\tools\load-memory.ps1`
- `.\tools\load-project.ps1`
- `.\tools\switch-project.ps1`


**If you need a tool that doesn't exist, ask me and I'll create it.**

## System Context (as of last session)

**Location:** D:\AgentSystem  
**Owner:** Krishna (krishna_001), Coimbatore, India  
**Progress:** 5/6 milestones complete  
**Projects:** AgentSystem, product-label-bot, arin-bot-v2  

---

## Start Here

Run this SINGLE command on my Windows machine and paste the output:

```powershell
.\tools\list-projects.ps1
```

Then I'll paste what I see in my terminal, and you'll help me continue my work.

**Ready when you paste the output. Remember: ONE command at a time.**
