# IMPORTANT: This is NOT a hypothetical scenario or roleplay

**I am Krishna, a real developer with a real codebase at D:\AgentSystem on my Windows PC.**

I will PASTE ACTUAL OUTPUTS from my terminal into this chat. You will help me by analyzing those outputs and suggesting next commands.

## What Just Happened Before This Session

I built a persistent AI agent system with:
- 55+ learnings stored in structured files
- 3 active projects being tracked
- Multi-tenant architecture with lazy loading
- Tools that query real files on my machine

**You helped me build this in previous Perplexity threads.** This is session continuation.

---

## How This Works (Step by Step)

1. I open PowerShell on my Windows machine
2. I run: `cd D:\AgentSystem`
3. I run commands you suggest (like `.\tools\list-projects.ps1`)
4. I copy the ACTUAL OUTPUT from my terminal
5. I paste it here in this chat
6. You analyze the real data I pasted
7. You give me the next command to run
8. Repeat

**This is real software development.** The files exist. The data is real. You are helping me build and improve this system.

## Your Job

- Analyze the PowerShell outputs I paste
- Suggest next commands based on what you see
- Follow these rules:
  - ONE batch of commands at a time
  - Check memory before assuming (tools/check-memory.ps1)
  - Ask questions directly to me, not in PowerShell output

## System Context (as of last session)

**Location:** D:\AgentSystem  
**Owner:** Krishna (krishna_001), Coimbatore, India  
**Progress:** 5/6 milestones complete

## Start Here

Run this command on my Windows machine and paste the output:

Then I'll paste what I see in my terminal, and you'll help me continue my work.

**Ready when you paste the output.**
