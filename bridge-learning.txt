## SUCCESSFUL: Message Detection
✓ Selector: .prose (Perplexity's message container)
✓ Detection working with 10-second refresh cycle
✓ Text extraction successful

## Key Learnings:
1. Perplexity uses .prose class for message containers
2. [data-testid="answer"] doesn't exist in current UI
3. page.reload() + sleep(3) successfully gets latest messages
4. Text preview shows first 500 chars

## Next: Command execution + paste back
